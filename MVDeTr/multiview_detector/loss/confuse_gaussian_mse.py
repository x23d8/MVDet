class ConfuseGaussianMSE(nn.Module):
    """
    MVDeTr port of multiview_detector/loss/confuse_gaussian_mse.py from the MVDet fork.

    Difference from the MVDet version: MVDet builds its Gaussian soft target inside the loss
    itself (_traget_transform convolves a hard occupancy map with a kernel at every call).
    MVDeTr instead bakes the final Gaussian heatmap once per frame in frameDataset.get_gt()
    (draw_umich_gaussian, CenterNet-style, peak=1 decaying outward) -- so `target` passed in
    here already IS soft_gt, no kernel argument needed.

    Same math otherwise, no pos_thr gate anywhere. A pixel is confuse-candidate purely by the
    model's own prediction: pred >= c (self.confuse_pred_thr). The confuse "forgiveness"
    strength then scales continuously with (1 - soft_gt):
      - soft_gt -> 1 (pixel at/near a KNOWN/KEPT person): forgiveness -> 0, falls back to
        plain MSE-to-soft_gt -- known people are protected automatically, no separate
        threshold needed.
      - soft_gt -> 0 (far from any known annotation): forgiveness -> full strength -- a
        confident prediction there is most likely a genuinely missed detection under
        partial annotation.
