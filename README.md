Please visit [link](https://github.com/hou-yz/MVDeTr) for our new work MVDeTr, a transformer-powered multiview detector that achieves new state-of-the-art!

## Overview
We release the PyTorch code for **MVDet**, a state-of-the-art multiview pedestrian detector; and **MultiviewX** dataset, a novel synthetic multiview pedestrian detection datatset.

## MultiviewX dataset
Using pedestrian models from [PersonX](https://github.com/sxzrt/Dissecting-Person-Re-ID-from-the-Viewpoint-of-Viewpoint), in Unity, we build a novel synthetic dataset **MultiviewX**.

MultiviewX dataset covers a square of 16 meters by 25 meters. We quantize the ground plane into a 640x1000 grid. There are 6 cameras with overlapping field-of-view in MultiviewX dataset, each of which outputs a 1080x1920 resolution image. We also generate annotations for 400 frames in MultiviewX at 2 fps (same as Wildtrack). On average, 4.41 cameras are covering the same location. 

### Download MultiviewX

## MVDet Code
This repo is dedicated to the code for **MVDet**.

### Dependencies
This code uses the following libraries
- python 3.7+
- pytorch 1.4+ & tochvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow
- opencv-python
- kornia
- wandb & python-dotenv
- matlab & matlabengine (required for evaluation) (see this [link](/multiview_detector/evaluation/README.md) for detailed guide)

### Data Preparation
By default, all datasets are in `~/Data/`. We use [MultiviewX](#multiviewx-dataset) and [Wildtrack](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-wildtrack/) in this project. 

On Kaggle, the dataset classes also automatically discover datasets mounted anywhere under
`/kaggle/input` or `/kaggle/working`, so the paths in the training scripts do not need to be changed.
The local `~/Data/` path is still preferred when it exists.
Generated ground-truth files for read-only datasets under `/kaggle/input` are written to
`/kaggle/working/mvdet_cache`. Set `MVDET_CACHE_DIR` to use a different cache directory.

Your `~/Data/` folder should look like this
```
Data
├── MultiviewX/
│   └── ...
└── Wildtrack/ 
    └── ...
```

### Training
The training entrypoint logs config, train/validation metrics, timings, and GPU usage to
the `GFA26AI02/baseline-expriments` Weights & Biases project. Put either
`WANDB_API_KEY=...` (preferred) or `WANDB_API=...` in the repository `.env` file.

Run one command per dataset; each command creates a separate, comparable W&B run:
```shell script
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python main.py -d wildtrack
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python main.py -d multiviewx
``` 
This should automatically return evaluation results similar to the reported 88.2\% MODA on Wildtrack dataset. 

The per-epoch eval metrics are logged under `test/moda`, `test/modp`, `test/precision`,
`test/recall`, `test/epoch_avg_loss`, `test/time_sec` (namespace `test/*`, not `validation/*`),
train loss under `train/epoch_avg_loss`, and learning rate under the bare key `lr` — matching the
key names used by [`Nhutan410/MVDeTr`](https://github.com/Nhutan410/MVDeTr)'s wandb logging, so runs
from both repos plot on the same chart in the shared `baseline-expriments` project. Metrics with no
MVDeTr equivalent (`train/precision_percent`, `test/grid_precision_percent`, `gpu/*`, `final_test/*`)
keep their own names and simply won't overlay with MVDeTr runs — that's expected.
